# AutoSplitter TODO Checklist

### General Features
- [ ] Quitting a stage in story mode, then pressing Continue
- [x] Restarting in Select Mode
  - has some funky double add during restart, but corrects itself after resume
- [ ] Quitting and Resuming a stage in Select Mode
- [ ] Game Mode in Story Mode (and Select in Reloaded)
- [ ] Resetting game due to crashing (include dolphin wipe/close scenario rather than reset button)

### Multi Path / Non Story Features
- [ ] 'number of splits' - you won't necessarily know how many stages to cleanup in Select Mode
  - Could make a special condition for totaling all IGTs up in a single split while in Select Mode until 71 A ranks is achieved
    - All keys minus 5, for last way.
    - Should be able to check that specific memory in case out of order
